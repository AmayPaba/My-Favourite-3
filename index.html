            My hobby is playing games in my free time when I am bored. like playing games because it relaxes me and I enjoy palying them.Playing games can give make anyone happy and give them relief from stress.Playing games is good but playing exxcessive games can hurt your eyes.Playing some difficult games also improve our multi-tasking and our logical thinking in certain situations.
